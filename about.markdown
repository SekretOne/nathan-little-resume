For the longest time, I used basic word or google docs for my resume. I thought to myself, "hey Nathan, that looks ugly and formatting is tedious as heck. Why not use some of the computer skills to present yourself in a more impressive way?"

## What Was Used

I settled on Jekyll as the base. While there are numerous existent resume themes, I wanted to indulge in dabbling with some more front end and design elements to familiarize myself again. This wasn't just about making a nicer resume, but also taking a side opportunity to crack my knuckles in space notoriously prone to rapid change.

The elements of the resume are data driven, formatted into includes and styled with SCSS. The theme base is `Minima.`
