I am a programming *master of many* with a decade of experience in software development. From architecture to testing,
pipelines to policy, bare-bone backends to flashy UIs: nothing is too big to beyond me, or too basic to beneath.
Ultimately, I solve problems. Thus, I pride myself on acquiring any skill that helps with that. My philosophy centers on
observability, honesty, and efficiency.
