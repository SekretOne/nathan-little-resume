With over a decade of programming experience, my skills range both and deep. From architecture, data modeling, API contracts,
pipelines, bare-bones backends to flashy UIs, nothing is too grand to be above, or too basic to be beneath me.

Ultimately, we're trying to make something happen- to solve some problem or make lives easier. I delight in the puzzle, 
and teaches others is just another kind of puzzle.
