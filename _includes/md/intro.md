With over a decade of experience in software development  (most of which in Agile based enterprise) I stand out as
particularly versatile and creative. From front-end to back-end, architecture to testing, graphic design to data
analysis, is all to the end: making things that help people.

You'll want me on the team if you're looking for someone who:

* is self-driven and independently discovers, prioritizes, and solves problems
* familiar with Agile practices (and its pitfalls)
* masters new skills quickly
* can mentor and teach those skills to others
