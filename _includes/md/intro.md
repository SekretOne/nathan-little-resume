I am a programming *master of many* with a decade of experience in software development. From architecture to testing,
pipelines to policy, bare-bone backends to flashy UIs: nothing is too big to beyond me, or too basic to beneath.
Ultimately, I solve problems, and I'm drawn to the particularly baffling ones where my eclectic skills and creativity
can turn the impossible into success.
